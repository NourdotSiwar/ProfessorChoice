1. Authnetication
* Struggled with signing and loggin in when my supabase version was different than other tutorials' versions, solved the issue by finding a tutorial that was using the same version as me.

2. CRUD operation
* Struggled with getting user id, solved by utilizing chatgpt to understand the bugs and what was the source
* Utilized chatgpt to add the upvote functionality as I struggled with having all posts update when I click only one button of one post
* Used chatgpt to create quick css templates for each page

3. search functionality
* struggled with search functionality between navigation bar and dashboard so i moved the bar to the dashboard and used one of my labs
* played with the css to understand why posts kept getting squished, solved by playing with the width

4. Detailed Post 
* Uitlized lab 6 to be able to post title and content

5. Flag System
* Struggled with filtering by question and opinion, utilized chatgpt and ended up being able to get more concise code that does multiple filtering

6. Comment System
* Struggled with figuring out how to start the comment system, utilized CRUD operations like I did with posts.
* Struggled with linking comments and posts id's, utilized chatgpt and my understanding of code to debug
* Struggled with passing parameters, opted to go through each line and redefined variable
